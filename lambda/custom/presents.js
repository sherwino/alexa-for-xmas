     'mom\'s second': 'This present is going to require that you check your email, it is a little something from Groupon. Hopefully you like getting foot massages',
     'rosy': 'I think you got your self a tiny little box, that, well, should help you keep your phone on. Don\'t lose it!',
     'rosy\'s second': 'ho ho ho, Apparently you get more than one present this year. Impressive. You might want to take a look at the poorly wrapped present with the llamas all over it. Remember that time that Mia ate your kindle? Well hopefully she won\'t eat this one',
     'jerel': 'Since you use your playstation to watch Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu more than anything else, I thought it might be cool to get you a remote. But this remote should work with the TV too, so hopefully you could control everything with this one remote. Maybe',
     'jerel\'s second': 'Your second gift is a little bit fancy er, you spend a bit of time on the bus, and on the train, these days so how about some good headphones. Ones that not only sound great but have a built in mic that you could use.',
     'rosy\'s 3rd': 'Well, well, well, you have yourself an appointment to make, how about a foot massage for you too. Best part about it, is that it is next to your job.'
